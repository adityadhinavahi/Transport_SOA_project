# Transport_SOA_project

## Currently we are aiming to finish the Dummy Implementation and start with a sync and async service design. 

### We require clarity on what is to be shown for dummy implementation, is the working need to be exported to any UI?

# To Do:
## 1. Get a clarity on data storage on the feedback
## 2. Find out ways to club one stop trips so as to calculate trip cost and time efficiently
## These are the Todos for now, see the notebook, and add if you have anymore to do...
